It has been one year, since I have last updated my blog.
So I thought that I should probably write at least one thing.

## JCON Europe

Tomorrow will be the JCON 2023 and, even though I did not expect it to happen, I am an official speaker for the conference.

This is a huge deal for me! Let's start by thanking everyone, that is part of this conference.
After initially being declined, my talk apparently was interesting enough to get accepted on a short notice.

The only time I was able to do the talk before was at an internal, closed conference at my current employee, RTL Technology.
Even though back then the presentation was in German, and, this time, I'll do it in English this helps me to stay calm.

Doing my first talk official talk is one of my goals for this year and I hope to be able to do this again in the future.
The preparation and thoughts I put into this talk exceeded what I planned to invest. By quite a lot! But I wouldn't want it any other way.

## My talk

My talk will be held with the title "Hosting applications in the real world". But hosting is a wide field, so what am I going to talk about?

The topic of my talk could probably be summarized with a simple keyword: "GitOps".
That means I'll be talking about Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code and give a really short introduction about this huge topic.

I actually only have 2 goals for my talk.

<ol>
    <li>Give an introduction into GitOps and what makes it great</li>
    <li>Spark some joy within somebodies mind</li>
</ol>

If I am able to reach both of these goals, I'll be happy.

## Final words

In the next days I'll be uploading my slides here, and I hope it's useful for someone.

I'm looking forward to meeting all the attendees and speakers, let's have a great time and talk about what we love most!

Till then, have a nice day.
